# hype

This Mastodon bot pulls trending posts from chosen instances, ranks them, and boosts the top results to your timeline. You decide which instances it fetches and how much you want to see per instance.

## Why

For smaller instances the local timeline is rather empty. This is why trends simply do not work on those instances: There is just not enough activity. Instead of manually checking out other instances this bot allows to subscribe to a multitude of different mastodon compatible servers to fetch trending posts and repost them to your current server helping discoverability of accounts, people and topics within the federated social web.

## Installation

Deploy with docker-compose

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  hype:
    image: ghcr.io/goingdark-social/hypebot:v0.1.0
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
```
Replace `v0.1.0` with the release you want to run.

## Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` and a `auth.yaml` file in `./config/`. Enter the credentials of your bot-account into `auth.yaml`. You can define which servers to follow and how often to fetch new posts as well as how to automatically change your profile in config.yaml. See the examples below:

`auth.yaml`:

```yaml
# Credentials for your bot account
bot_account:
  server: "mastodon.example.com"
  access_token: "Create a new application in your bot account at Preferences -> Development"
```

`config.yaml`

```yaml
# Refresh interval in minutes
interval: 60

# Text to add to the bot profile befor the list of subscribed servers
profile_prefix: "I am boosting trending posts from:"

# profile fields to fill in
fields:
  code: https://github.com/v411e/hype
  operator: "YOUR HANDLE HERE"

# Define subscribed instances and
# their individual limit (top n trending posts)
# which is again limited by the API to max 20
subscribed_instances:
  chaos.social:
    limit: 20
  mastodon.social:
    limit: 5

# Filter posts from specific instances
filtered_instances:
  - example.com

daily_public_cap: 48
per_hour_public_cap: 1
max_boosts_per_run: 5
max_boosts_per_author_per_day: 1
author_diversity_enforced: true
prefer_media: 1
require_media: true
skip_sensitive_without_cw: true
min_reblogs: 0
min_favourites: 0
languages_allowlist:
  - en
  - sv
state_path: "/app/secrets/state.json"
seen_cache_size: 6000
hashtag_scores:
  python: 10
  rust: 5
```

`min_reblogs` and `min_favourites` let you ignore posts that haven't gained enough traction yet.
`seen_cache_size` limits how many posts the bot remembers to avoid boosting duplicates.
`hashtag_scores` lets you push posts with certain hashtags to the front by assigning weights.
`prefer_media` adds the given bonus to posts with attachments; set to `true` for a default of `1`.
`author_diversity_enforced` respects `max_boosts_per_author_per_day` when enabled.
`max_boosts_per_run` limits how many posts get boosted in each run.
`max_boosts_per_author_per_day` stops the bot from boosting the same author over and over.

**Migration note**: The `rotate_instances` option has been removed. The bot now checks every subscribed instance each run, so older configs should drop this field.
